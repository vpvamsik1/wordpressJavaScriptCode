JavaScript code fore caremd.us

This website was built of a WordPress template and it was customized heavily for my client's business. I used a lot of JavaScript to make specific changes for UI development. 

For example, in the "providers" section in the home page, the template originally only had a row for only 3 "Provider" profiles. And to add another providers's profile would add that person in a new line below the 3 originals. It was like this because each profile had one class called "col-lg-4" and through javscript, I managed to take out "col-lg-4" and replace it with "col-lg-3." And I did this for all the profiles and for different grids. You can see how I did this in the lines 47 - 69 in the "main.js" file of this repository. 

Another example of JavaScript being used on this application is on each of the service section pages. Take for example, "Laboratory Services," where when one of the services is clicked the green box in the bottom instantly gets different text added to it for each different service. All of the code in the "laboratoryServices.js" page and the other ".js" files will show how I was able to do this for the "Laboratory Services" pages and all the "Services" pages. 

The "main.js" file also has much more JavaScript code that I was able to use to change this app from the template.
